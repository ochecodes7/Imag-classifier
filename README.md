
## Requirements

* [docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox)

## Usage 

You just need to make a "classifier" directory with a directory "data" inside it with all your images
For example
```
 [any_path]/my_own_classifier/
 [any_path]/my_own_classifier/data
 [any_path]/my_own_classifier/data/car
 [any_path]/my_own_classifier/data/moto
 [any_path]/my_own_classifier/data/bus
```
 and then put your image on it. 
 This "classifier" directory will have your samples but also trained classifier after execution of "train.sh". 

## Train process
 
Just type
```
 ./train.sh [any_path]/my_own_classifier
``` 
And it will do anything for you !

## Guess process

Just type for a single guess
```
 ./guess.sh [any_path]/my_own_classifier /yourfile.jpg
```

To guess an entire directory
```
./guessDir.sh [any_path]/classifier [any_path]/srcDir [any_path]/destDir
```

## Example of result
```
# ./guess.sh /synced/tensor-lib/moto-classifier/ /synced/imagesToTest/moto21.jpg
moto (score = 0.88331)
car (score = 0.11669)
```

Use an absolute file path for classifier and images because the script dos not support relative path (volume mounting)
